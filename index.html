          <h2>I'm <strong>Theodore D.</strong></h2>
          <p class=subtitle>Undergraduate programmer looking for internship. I'm a fan of Linux and communication in-person.</p>
          <p class=not-subtitle>In 2022 I got an obsession with Linux and I learned to adapt to different coding styles. Today I'm balancing my life better but programming is still my main hobby.</p>

          <h2>Bits of experience</h2>
          <ul class=xx>
            <li>I entered the <u at=uni>University of Athens</u> in 2019. We write C, C++ and Python code and one focus is to explore the internals of databases, parallel processing and old-school artificial intelligence.</li>
            <li>Apart from the University I <u at=scmd>scrap together</u> some utilities code as a hobby. I still use some of them. Some have been through a number of phases where they became complicated and simple again.</li>
            <li>In 2024 I interned at a chat bot and AI company called <u at=helvia>Helvia</u>. The first out of three months I tried connecting two repositories with Docker files and then I made a web app to learn backend.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key streaming app</h2>
          <p>To learn backend web development in my internship, I prototyped an app using the tools I had to learn. It was inspired by these moments when someone sends a long message and you wish you could interrupt them. It uses <u at=reactjs>ReactJS</u>, <u at=nextjs>NextJS</u>, plain CSS and Python's <u at=fastapi>FastAPI</u>. The protocol and some UI quirks had to be improvised.</p>

          <i>Messaging app that outlines deleted text and has a button saying clear. The input box has the same text as two messages above it.</i>

          <h2>This portfolio</h2>
          <ul class=portfolio-iterations>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><u at=pf1>Visit the first iteration</u></li>
                <li><u at=pf1gh>Code on GitHub</u></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In 2023 I used short PHP functions that print HTML, inspired by <u at=cleancode>Clean Code</u>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><u at=pf2>Second iteration</u></li>
                <li><u at=pf2gh>GitHub</u></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Then, I tried to use PHP the intended way. The challenge was to keep the Greek version consistent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><u at=pf3>Third iteration</u></li>
                <li><u at=pf3gh>GitHub</u></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The third time, I fit all the code in one HTML file and there was a script that produced the Greek file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><u at=pf4gh>GitHub</u></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the end, I managed without a script using JavaScript. That was inspired by a <u at=nobuild>talk by DHH</u> about build steps.</p>

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <big>Demonstrations</big>
            <p>Demonstrations, prototypes and user tests reveal problems early.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <big>Communication</big>
            <p>I find that understanding people makes work easier and more fun.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <big>Simple needs</big>
            <p>Simple code can be laborous and risky, but I tend to prefer it.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I tend to prefer teams where it's easy to try out a piece of code to some degree, perhaps using automated tests without integration or by having a build system that allows one to try a part of the system. I prefer working in person usually, depending on the distance from home and the team. It's easier to tell when it's the right time to strike a short conversation, in person.</p>
