              Undergraduate programmer looking for internship. Fan of Linux and face to face interactions.
            </big>
            <p>
              In 2022 I got an obsession with Linux and I learned to adapt to coding styles. Today I've balanced my life better but programming is still my main hobby.
            </p>

          <h2>Bits of experience</h2>
          <ol>
          <li>
            In the University, <u at=uni>University of Athens</u>, we wrote plenty of code in C, C++ and Python to mimic the internals of databases, parallel processing computers, old-school artificial intelligence and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the first semister, ACM invited us to practice by making a compiler and I took part and tried to follow. In February 2025, now, I'm joining ACM's <u at=sigmod>SIGMOD</u> low level programming contest.
          </li>
          <li>
            At home I hacked together an <u at=scmd>app-launching mechanism</u> and other tools in Linux that I still use. They were rewritten many times each, the first iterations added complexity and today they're "flat."
          </li>
          <li>
            I interned in 2024 at a company that creates chat bots called <u at=helvia>Helvia</u>. For a month I tried connecting two repositories with Docker files and for the next two I made a web app to learn backend.

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3><u at=keymouth>One letter at a time messaging app</u></h3>
              <p>
                To learn backend web development in my internship, I prototyped an app using the tools I had to learn. It was inspired by these moments when someone sends a long message and you wish you could interrupt them. It uses <u at=reactjs>ReactJS</u> and <u at=nextjs>NextJS</u> in the front end, with plain CSS and so far no TypeScript. The backend is written in Python with a library that only defines the end points, called <u at=fastapi>FastAPI</u>. The protocol and some UI quirks had to be hand written.

              <p>Try KeyMouth</p>
              <p>Source code on GitHub</p>
              <i>Messaging app with an input bar saying stream typing, a menu has two chat rooms, a theme button and links saying author and GitHub.</i>
              <i>Messaging app that outlines deleted text and has a button saying clear. The input box has the same text as two messages above it.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><u at=pfgh>This portfolio</u></h3>
              <p>
                In 2023 I used short PHP functions that print HTML, inspired by <u at=cleancode>Clean Code</u>.
              </p>
              <u at=pf1>Visit the first iteration</u>
              <u at=pf1gh>Code on GitHub</u>
              <p>
                The challenge was to serve in Greek and English. I tried plain PHP too.
              </p>
              <u at=pf2>Visit the second iteration</u>
              <u at=pf2gh>GitHub</u>
              <p>
                Then I wrote one HTML file with CSS, JS and SVGs and a script that translates it.
              </p>
              <u at=pf3>Visit the third iteration</u>
              <p>
                Inspired by a <u at=nobuild>talk by DHH</u>, I got rid of the build step, using JavaScript.

          <h2>Values</h2>
          <h3>Demonstrations</h3>
          <p>
            Prototypes, user tests, whiteboards and one thought at a time.
          </p>
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
            It gives me security to know where people's takes come from.
          </p>
          <h3>Simple needs</h3>
          <p>
            Rewriting simple code to scale it is a trade-off I tend to like.
          </p>

          <h2>Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            Generally I prefer social teams. It's true that nerdy teams are friendly and more open and inclusive like a family, they're not for me however. I'm totally fine with social people who make fun of me for being weird, I also like talking to older people or energetic people who make noise sometimes and I'm open to different ethnicities and interests, but nerds bring me bad memories. I've been the only person of the team that didn't pass the course, twice. I've been ghosted and they came to me hours before the deadline for help, twice. These are four different people. I've done UI user tests and they dismissed them, generally when I offer some way to save up time people don't take it and that drives my nerves. I haven't had such problems with social people. I suppose I can work with a nerdy team again and I'll get used to it over time, but if there's a more social team I'd go for it first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideally, I'd like a team that practices test driven development or has some other way to make it easy to try out the code and take it apart. It's not necessary, but I've written code that has convenient tests and I'd like to write such code as a job. I wrote fast tests for the KeyMouth project for example, with the one letter at a time messages, and they were fast enough that I could run them without much thought. There are some tests that try wiring the backend with a half set up front end, which are slow tests, but for the pagination, for translating the input stream to a data structure similar to the UI, for responding to empty messages, there are tests that don't wire things up and I just run them all every time I make a small change. I don't write tests in many projects but when I do it makes them fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I prefer working in person in an office. There are benefits to working from home but in my internship at <u at=helvia>Helvia</u>, when we met in the office, I could tell when it's a good time to throw a question. A messaging app tells you if the other person is on a call but from up close you can tell if they're focused, tired or relaxed. Also, in person, it's very easy to peek at another's screen. This can be both good and bad, but I've opened fun discussions from looking at people's screens. The most important benefit though is that you can say something in a word or two as someone is talking to you. When I message someone to ask if they see something obviously wrong about my work, they are tempted to give a long answer and in person you can make something good out of that, but in messages it's trickier. So I prefer working close to the others.
