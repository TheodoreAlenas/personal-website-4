          <ul class=xx>
            <li>I'm in the <u at=uni>University of Athens</u> since 2019, I'll likely graduate in February 2026. I've been in <strong>5-10 team projects</strong>. I lean on <strong>C/C++</strong> subjects.</li>
            <li>I've <u at=scmd>scraped together</u> little programs as a hobby, I used them for years. When I re-write them I go for the <strong>fewest tools</strong>. I used to be crazy on <strong>Linux</strong>.</li>
            <li>I interned at <u at=helvia>Helvia</u> in 2024. I used <strong>Docker</strong> to connect two repositories and then I made a <strong>web app</strong> to learn backend.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Soft skills</h2>
          <ul class=xx>
            <li>If it's not clear how to use a library or what it's made for, this is the part that motivates me the most. <strong>I can look it up</strong> all day.</li>
            <li>If someone needs to <strong>simplify technical information</strong> to someone less technical, I'm always prepared to do that.</li>
            <li><strong>I don't fear trashing.</strong> If I code something without telling people, I don't give that code any status. I love user testing that makes me redo a UI design.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Technical skills</h2>
          <ul class=xx>
            <li>I've been on <strong>Linux</strong> since 2022, I'm familiar with the file system and shell scripting. I'm less familiar with Docker.</li>
            <li>I've used C++, Java and Python a number of times so I can understand the basics of <strong>OOP and design patterns</strong>. I was big on Robert C. Martin once.</li>
            <li>I used to toy around with <strong>CSS</strong> a lot and I can manipulate it today to make widgets. I'm less familiar with CSS libraries.</li>

          <h2>Key streaming app</h2>
          <p>To learn backend web development in my internship, I prototyped an app using the tools I had to learn. It was inspired by these moments when someone sends a long message and you wish you could interrupt them. It uses <u at=reactjs>ReactJS</u>, <u at=nextjs>NextJS</u>, plain CSS and Python's <u at=fastapi>FastAPI</u>. The protocol and some UI quirks had to be improvised.</p>

          <p>
            Today this site is old school HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some tricks for Greek support. There have been many, many re-writes since 2023, with PHP, short CSS classes and Python scripts.

        <p>I should mention I used to be stoic and simple in a bad way, much worse than the average programmer, and as I tried to socialize, it's become harder to cooperate in environments where you prove yourself or places where you compete for control. I can cooperate about fine, but ghosting can demotivate me, or when people express ideas by telling me what to press on my laptop I say no, if someone shows up with code that I was supposed to write I take it as a threat, I've lost appreciation for strict hierarchies and fights. I plan to stay in programming for 5-10 years, both because it pays and because I want to get good and work while I'm good, but my dream would be to sell crepes. I don't explode and I want to believe I don't bring too much negative energy, but I feel out of place. It's where it's tempting for the others to ignore me. I can contribute, lately I've been lowering my guard more and more and my plan is to try to get recognized in the beginning of the project and by the second week just obey whoever the others seem to listen to the most. I recognize that the "programming mindset" works and the communities can be charming and adventurous.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to meeting you!</p>
