<h1>Hi, I'm Theodore!</h1>
<p>
My name is Theodoros Dimakopoulos
and I'm a Greek undergraduate software developer.
I like face to face interactions and concepts such as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kScFczWbwRM">TDD</a>.
I'm looking for a 6 month part time internship,
or maybe a 3 month full time one,
so I can get my degree.
Please mind that I won't be available on March 2024.

<h2>Web development</h2>
<p>
In July 2024 I interned full time
<a href="https://helvia.ai/">at Helvia</a>,
one month on DevOps/operations and for two months
I learned NextJS, MongoDB and Python's FastAPI by
<a href="https://theodoros-d-alenas.site/key-mouth/"
>making Key Mouth</a>.
It's a chat app that shows each key instead of messages.
It was hard mainly because there's no point of reference to hold onto.
</p>
<p>
Before joining Helvia, we had web development related courses and
I tried PostGres SQL, MySQL and MongoDB,
I read code in VueJS and Python's Jango and
I tried learning Spring in Java and Kotlin multiple times.
On my own, I entered a few Docker containers to look around in them
and I played around with Jest and Typescript a little.
</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>
I tried WSL in 2020, I believe,
then I went to Linux Mint and then,
because I couldn't figure out how to use minimal tools on Mint,
I installed Arch Linux with the manual installation.
I was 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube"
>motivated mostly by the DistroTube channel</a>
on YouTube
but I'm not into that mindset anymore.
</p>
<p>
I used the shell a lot and eventually I got good at
using the POSIX features in scripts and interactive sessions.
One day I rented an Alpine Linux server
to use it for backups and for serving this site with NginX and certbot.
Although it went well, I wouldn't say I'm good at serving sites.
There's downtime here and there,
the certificates are off a little so some browsers don't show the site,
but I've made it thus far.
</p>
<h2>Social experiences</h2>
<p>
I was a stereotypical programmer until about 2021,
today I have a close friend,
I've watched movies with friends a few times,
I've had somewhat of a party at my house
and I went on 2 dates.
I'm trying to speedrun a bit before I reach my 30.
It's going well and I love meeting new people.
</p>
<p>
In University projects
I embraced UX user tests,
I introduced teammates to automated tests
and in two projects I demonstrated some draft prototypes.
None of this went well though and that's a topic that
frustrates me to no end, we can talk about the details.
On the other hand there was a project with friends where
we were face to face
2 months, 4 hours a day, 4 days a week at a minimum,
working on it together and that was my favorite project.
We read about the Rust compiler and the syntax
and we wrote a text about it.

<h2>The 2 rewrites of this site</h2>
<p>
The site used to support both Greek and English and it had a menu.
</p>
<h3>Identity buffee</h3>
<p>
Abstract PHP functions that compose HTML code.
It's still <a href="../../old-versions/13-before-abandoning/en/index.html"
>served</a> and it's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/personal-website-1/"
>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>include_once(&quot;common/wraps/<b>typical-layouts</b>.php&quot;);
[...]
function <b>get_biography_html</b>(string $language) &lbrace;
  return <b>get_typical_layout</b>&lpar;
    $language,</code></pre>

<h3>Fewest layers possible</h3>
<p>
Abstractions got replaced with abbreviations.
I serve an
<a href="../../old-versions/20-hamburger-menu/en/index.html"
>older</a> and a
<a href="../../old-versions/21-blue-mountains-many-themes/en/index.html"
>newer</a> version
and it's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/personal-website-2/"
>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php $STR_XML = <b>simplexml_load_file</b>(&quot;biography/bio-high-school.xml&quot;) ?&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>title</b>&quot;) ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>graduated</b>&quot;) ?&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://2lyk-amaliad.ilei.sch.gr/wordpress17/&quot;
    &gt;&lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>high_school</b>&quot;) ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Least text possible</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kevinpowell.co/">Kevin Powell's site</a>
inspired me to reduce the text,
to the point that I could serve hand written HTML.
</p>
<pre><code><b>&lt;h3&gt;</b>Fewest layers possible<b>&lt;/h3&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;p&gt;</b>

&gt;</b>older<b>&lt;/a&gt;</b> and a</code></pre>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
At first it looks like I lowered the requirements to get away with draft code
but I'd say the requirements overall went up.
It was a requirement to be laconic,
one could say there was a requirement to
make the browser tools reflect the source code better,
and it's fun to hand write HTML with no indentation.
</p>
<h2>The 3 rewrites of my hotkey system</h2>
<p>
I use an odd operating system which relies on key combinations
becuase there's no taskbar or bars on windows.
I had one real option, to use
<a href="https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd"><code>sxhkd</code></a>,
but I wanted a pop-up guide too like
<a href="https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim"><code>which-key</code></a>.
</p>
<h3>Prompt for next key</h3>
<p>
3 bash scripts and the language shown below.
A terminal appeared to hint what keys are allowed.
</p>
<pre><code><b>s *screenshot</b>   sel=$(slop -f &quot;-i %i -g %g&quot;); shotgun $sel /tmp/screenshot.png
<b>S *scrsh-fulls</b>  sleep 0; shotgun /tmp/screenshot.png</code></pre>
<p>
The terminal messed with the notion of previous window
and caused painful bugs.
</p>
<h3>Hotkey shell commands</h3>
<p>
A new demand was that
Win + e, Win + Alt + r
should also be possible from the terminal as
<code>al e +r</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another new demand is that Win + m, Win + v
is bound to <code>pacmd set-sink-volume 0 ...</code>
and I'll be prompted to fill in the gap.
It's uploaded on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/hotkey-system-2-alk"
>GitHub</a> after the fact.
</p>
<pre><code><b>video | V)</b> mpv_shut_up $(find ~/img/go -name '*.mp4' | shuf) <b>;;</b>
<b>screenshot | s)</b> sxiv /tmp/screenshot.png <b>;;</b></code></pre>
<p>
The configuration code was verbose
and the commands couldn't be listed reliably.
It wasn't actually used it in the terminal either.
</p>
<h3>Code snippet composer</h3>
<p>
The sunken cost fallacy.
It's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/alsnip/blob/main/example-config/reset.sh"
>GitHub</a>.
The demands went up
but they weren't based on real needs.
</p>
<p>
There had to be a list of text snippets,
some of which are operating system commands,
some of which are bound to hotkeys.
Some can prompt for completion.
The completion gives hints,
a bar shows the final command that ran,
and each text snippet has an easily accessible description.
Other purposes for the text snippets were shell aliases,
copying ASCII art and
completing parts of a C for loop and copying it.
Below is part of the list that appeared on the screen.
</p>
<pre><code>vol1  .m1 /auto   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 6000
vol0  .m0 /auto   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 0
wm_t7 .!7 /auto   | bspc node --to-desktop temporary --follow
wm_b7 .^7 /auto   | bspc node @temporary:/ --to-desktop focused</code></pre>
<p>
The configuration was shell scripts that printed shell scripts.
It became so slow that I considered caching.
</p>
<h3>Self-installing shell script</h3>
<pre><code><b>about_logging</b>() { <b>tail /tmp/scmd.sh</b>; echo &quot;Should have lines that look like: <b>func() { echo hi; } #>>hi</b>&quot;; }
<b>about_why</b>() { echo &quot;<b>For the syntax highlighting and to reduce bugs</b>. I've made many abstract hotkey systems.&quot;; }
  [...]
<b>volume_set_8</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 48000; } <b>#m8</b>
<b>volume_set_9</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 54000; } <b>#m9</b>
<b>volume_set_custom</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 &quot;$(:|dmenu)&quot;; }
  [...]
<b>scmd_run</b>() &lbrace; c=&quot;$(dmenu &lt; &quot;$(<b>this_file</b>)&quot; | cut -d&#039;(&#039; -f1)&quot;; test &quot;$c&quot; &amp;&amp; <b>scmd_with_bar_status</b> &quot;$c&quot;; &rbrace; <b>#x</b>
  [...]
<b>this_file</b>() { echo ~/.config/scmd.sh; }</code></pre>
<p>
I got syntax highlighting in my configuration file,
I got a listing, a superset of the hotkey commands,
a bar saying what ran,
I could run the same actions from the terminal
and for the first time I could easily log the commands and their output.
</p>
<p>
It's on <a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/dotfiles/blob/main/scmd.sh"
>GitHub</a> among my dotfiles.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
This project made me think of code as a person going through phases.
It started relatable, then it became fancy and then almost grumpy.
Just like the website, I ended up with one file with flat hierarchies.
Maybe at scale a project can't go through phases in the same way,
but this is an experience that I can't explain to people
and I wish we could all talk about it.
</p>
<h2>Other experiments at home</h2>
<p>
Some other stories are
the directory structure of my laptop
which was restructured 4 times alongside its remote backup,
the image tagging facilities which used python GUIs at first,
I tried to make my computer look mysterious and mesmerizing
but I became more of a minimalist along the way,
I tried to &quot;clean-up&quot; the
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/"><code>dmenu</code></a>
project but I lost my ego when I made it oddly worse and I re-wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/">clock pop-up</a>
from Python to C and made it uglier.
</p>
<p>
Although I found complexity and mysticism more attractive,
if there were high demands and I was ready to question my ideas,
the projects eventually became flat in hierarchies and weird.
The code needed some explaining,
but there wasn't much code in the first place.
</p>
<h2>Thank you very much</h2>
<p>
I hope you enjoyed the read.
Have a nice day!
